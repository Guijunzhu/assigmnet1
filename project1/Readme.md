#Reflection:
In the course of completing this assignment, it went relatively smoothly, However, there were also some problems. 

On the positive side, I learned how to use JQuary for one-click back to the top, and how to implement layouts using ONLY CSS In addition, I also learned how to adjust some parameters to make the whole page look more consistent with the theme.

What needs to be improved, I am not very skilled in the operation of CSS Grid. For example, in the <section>, I tried to use CSS Grid to design the layout, but the result was not what I wanted.
In addition, what I need to practice is how to treat some codes as a container. In the design process, I personally think Grid Container is more convenient and faster than items, but I am not good at treating some things as a container, and I always want to design separately.

For this assignment, I mainly encountered the following problems:
In my work, I found that some CSS Grid codes didn't work well sometimes, so I used a lot of CSS Flex, and I put my unsuccessful CSS grid code at the end of the CSS file, I would appreciate it if you could tell me how to solve these problems.

In the next stage, I will continue to contact how to design the layout through CSS Grid. In addition, I will strengthen the study of Jquary and strive to make a more interactive website
